# Image-segmentation-using-Unet
This repository implements image segmentation using the U-Net architecture, a neural network designed for tasks like biomedical image segmentation. It captures context with a contracting path and ensures precise localization with an expanding path. Train the model using your dataset and visualize segmentation results.
